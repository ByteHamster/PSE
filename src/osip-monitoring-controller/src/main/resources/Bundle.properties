monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.header=Shell
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.introduction=The OSIP monitoring shell can be used to monitor the tanks, pipes and alarms of the production site simulation via the OPC UA protocol.
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.layoutSection=Shell Layout
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.layoutText=The layout of the monitoring shell can be divided into five parts. At first there are the information about the upper tanks of the production site. These boxes are located at the upper side of the shell and are bordered in the color of the liquid in the tank. Right of those parts is the information about the mix tank which is also bordered in the color of the mix tank. Underneath those boxes there is a textfield which is used to print alarm messages.
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.alarmSection=Alarms
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.alarmText=Every tank box has four possible alarms which are shown as small green or red circles at the upper left corner of the box. If the circle is green the alarm is not active, if it is red then the alarm is active. Additionally there is a big red and green circle at the bottom right of the shell. If the red circle is filled, some alarm is active and if the green circle is filled, no alarm is active.
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.gaugeSection=Gauges
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.gaugeText=Every tank box has four gauges showing various properties of the tank. The gauge at the upper left side shows the input flow rate of liquid flowing into the tank. The gauge at the upper right side shows the output flow rate of liquid flowing out of the tank. Below is a fill rate gauge and a temperature scale.
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.progressSection=Progress diagram
monitoring.helpdialog.mainTab.progressText=Below the gauges are two progress diagrams, accessible via two tabs, which show the progress of the fill level and the temperature. This can be used to analize the history of the fill level and temperature changes.
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.header=Settings
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.introduction=The settings can be opened by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting the menu entry "Settings"
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.generalSection=General Settings
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.generalText=The general settings tab can be used to configure the update interval, which is the frequency used by the monitor to request data from the production site simulation. Additionally one can specify the hostname or IP-address of the production site simulation by filling it into the "Server-Hostname" field. Below this field one can select the IP ports of every tank.
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.progressSection=Progress Settings
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.progressText=The progressions tab can be used to select whether the progress of temperature or fill level of a tank should be recorded and displayed or not. Check the checkbox to enable progress recording and displaying.
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.alarmSection=Alarm Settings
monitoring.helpdialog.settingsTab.alarmText=The alarm tab can be used to select which alarm conditions should be shown in the shell. It is possible to control this behaviour for every single alarm. Check the checkbox to enable the alarm and uncheck it to disable the alarm.
